Dear \companyname Recruitment Team,


I am hereby applying for the position as \positionname.


I have a long experience in programming, and would classify myself as very proficient. Except from all my university and pre-university education, programming has been a hobby of mine for over 10 years. It has taken me very far, for example I was selected as one of the four best pre-university students to participate in the prestigious International Olympiad in Informatics on Sweden's behalf. I have also been working as a programmer during school holidays, most recently at Unfors RaySafe, where I was involved in and responsible for a number of software projects. 



As a Master student in Engineering Physics, by many considered as one of the toughest university educations in Sweden, I am a very skilled problem solver, and I really love solving problems. Usually some kind of programming is involved in the problem solving, as was the case in my Bachelor's project, in which I simulated a proposed particle detector and did extensive programmatic data analysis to determine its possible performance. 


I am one of the top students at the Engineering Physics program, with a perfect GPA. This has awarded me some scholarships and also TA positions in several courses. 


To conclude, I think I would be the perfect candidate for the advertised position.

Please find my resume with this cover letter or online at \url{www.rikardlundmark.com}. I look forward to hearing from you.



Sincerely, \\
Rikard Lundmark
