\section*{Education}

\subsection*{Ongoing}
\begin{description}
\item[Chalmers Tekniska Högskola (2009-2014)] Civilingenjör Teknisk Fysik (Master of Science in Engineering Physics). Up to the date of this document I have highest grades in all subjects.
\item[National University of Singapore (2012-2013)] Exchange student. Awarded the \emph{ASEM-DUO} scholarship.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Finished}
\begin{description}
\item[Primary school (1997-2006)] Åsenskolan, Anderstorp. Highest grades in all theoretical subjects.
\item[Secondary school (2006-2009)] The Natural Science programme at Gislaveds Gymnasium, Gislaved. Course of study: extended. Highest grades in all subjects. Finished all mathematics-, physics-, and chemistry courses that the school offered in less than 2 years instead of the normal 3 years, and was awarded scholarships and premiums for my outstanding results.
\item[University education] University courses studied simultaneously with my secondary school education, corresponding to 30 ECTS credits distributed on four 7,5 credits courses, all with the highest grade: \emph{Högskolan i Gävle (2008)} - Linear Algebra, Advanced Linear Algebra, Single Variable Calculus. \emph{Umeå Universitet (2008-2009)} -  Analogue Electronics I.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Research}
During the {\bf summer 2011} I spent five weeks doing a research project at the Subatomic physics research group (Fundamental Physics department) at Chalmers University of Technology. The aim of the project was to evaluate a proposed particle-detector design using mathematical models and self-written simulations. During the {\bf spring 2012} the project was finished and became my bachelor's thesis (\url{http://fy.chalmers.se/subatom/kand/2012/precalib/}).

\section*{Employment}

\begin{description}
\item[2010]\emph{Chalmers University of Technology}, Göteborg. Teaching assistant, Computer Science and Engineering. I mainly answered questions from students and graded their assignnments in the computer introduction course. I worked about 5 hours per week during the course (which is 7 weeks). 
\item[2011]\emph{Chalmers University of Technology}, Göteborg. Teaching assistant, Fundamental Physics. I mainly answered questions from students and graded their assignnments in the computer introduction course. I worked about 5 hours per week during the course (which is 7 weeks). 
\item[2011-2012]\emph{Chalmers University of Technology}, Göteborg. Teaching assistant, Mathematical Sciences. I held classes for about 30 students a time, a few times a week. The extent of the work was 12-15 hours per week.
\end{description}


\subsection*{Summer jobs}
\begin{description}
\item[2005-2008] \emph{Wibe Defem AB}, Anderstorp. Industrial work, my tasks were e.g. to pack items for delivery.
\item[2009] \emph{Recticel AB}, Gislaved. Industrial work, my tasks were e.g. to pack mattresses for delivery to customers. 
\item[2010-2012] \emph{Unfors AB}, Göteborg. Programmer, R\&D. I developed software for different purposes in \verb+C\#+, \verb+ASP.NET+ and \verb.C++.. 
\end{description}


\subsection*{Miscellaneous}
During {\bf 2009} I spent two weeks of work practice at \emph{Blue Tree} in Galway, Ireland, developing a web interface for retrieving statistics from databases and for server monitoring. 

\section*{Extracurricular activities}
\begin{description}
\item[Anderstorps Tennisklubb 2004-2009] \emph{Webmaster}. I was responsible for administrating and updating Anderstorps tennisclub's web page.
\item[Projektbanken 2009-2010] \emph{Project group member}. \href{http://www.fuf.org/projektbanken/}{Projektbanken} is a cooperation project between \href{http://www.fuf.org/}{Swedish Feder-} \href{http://www.fuf.org/}{ation of Young Scientists (FUF)} and Swedish universities providing direct contact between researchers and secondary school students. This makes it possible for the most ambitious students to do research projects before starting university, and thus aims to stimulate their scientific interest. As one of six members in the project group, my main responsibilities were IT and contact with researchers and teachers.
\item[F-spexet 2011] \emph{Organizing member}. \href{http:///www.f-spexet.se}{F-spexet} is a student organisation for physics students at Chalmers University of Technology, whose purpose is to create a \emph{spex} (student comedy show) each year.
\item[Intize 2011-2012] \emph{Mentor}. \href{http://www.intize.org}{Intize} is an organization for helping students learning mathematics by assigning them university students as mentors to coach them in their studies. As a mentor I had four students, which I helped for a few hours every week. 
\end{description}
